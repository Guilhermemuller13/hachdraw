## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Organization
The project was developed with a clear division of responsibilities, both in CSS and JavaScript.


### JavaScript:
The JavaScript code was divided into specific files, each responsible for a different functionality:

- **`controlHatching.js`**: Manages the logic for drawing, applying and removing hatches in images.
- **`controlModeDraw.js`**: Defines and manages drawing modes or just visualization.
- **`controlPaginate.js`**: Implements navigation and pagination functionality between different images.
- **`index.js`**: Main file that integrates all the functionalities, starting the application.
- **`utils.js`**: Contains functions for persisting data in storage.

### CSS:
The CSS files have been organized by component, ensuring that each one has a clear scope and avoids overlapping styles:


- **`content.css`**: Styles applied to the main content of the application.
- **`footer.css`**: Specific styles for the footer.
- **`navbar.css`**: Styles related to the navigation bar.
